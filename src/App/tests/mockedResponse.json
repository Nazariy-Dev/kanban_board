    "body": "When React hoists style rules using `<style precedence=\"...\" href=\"...\">{...rules}</style>` it does not accept arbitrary props. The reason is that while it looks like you are rendering a single tag here each tag with the same precedence will get grouped together in a single style tag in the serialized output. Really you are rendering a style rule more than a style element and so there is no natural place to put arbitrary props on this style tag since they might conflict. A trivial example is\n```\n<style precedence=\"default\" href=\"123\" data-x=\"red\">{redRules}</style>\n<style precedence=\"default\" href=\"abc\" data-x=\"blue\">{blueRules}</style>\n```\nthe resultant stylesheet will look like this\n```html\n<style data-precedence=\"default\" data-href=\"123 abc\">\n  ...redRules\n  ...blueRules\n</style>\n```\n\nwe can't put both red and blue as the value of `data-x` property so we simply omit it. Ideally with a warning.\n\nHowever... `nonce` is special.\n\nWith nonces they only make sense if you use the same value for all styles. Additionally if you are using a nonce for non-trivial CSP purposes then all styles should have the nonce otherwise they will be ignored. So there is no conflict in adopting the first `nonce` value we see for a style tag that is hoisted.",

    "body": "Stacked on #32427.\r\n\r\nThis adds a `ReactFiberApplyGesture` which is basically intended to be a fork of the phases in `ReactFiberCommitWork` except for the fake commit that `useSwipeTransition` does. So far none of the phases are actually implemented yet. This is just the scaffolding around them so I can fill them in later.\r\n\r\nThe important bit is that we call `startViewTransition` (via the `startGestureTransition` Config) when a gesture starts. We add a paused animation to prevent the transition from committing (even if the ScrollTimeline goes to 100%). This also locks the documents so that we can't commit any other Transitions until it completes.\r\n\r\nWhen the gesture completes (scroll end) then we stop the gesture View Transition. If there's no new work scheduled we do that immediately but if there was any new work already scheduled, then we assume that this will potentially commit the new state. So we wait for that to finish. This lets us lock the animation in its state instead of snapping back and then applying the real update.\r\n\r\nUsing this technique we can't actually run a View Transition from the current state to the actual committed state because it would snap back to the beginning and then run the View Transition from there. Therefore any new commit needs to skip View Transitions even if it should've technically animated to that state. We assume that the new state is the same as the optimistic state you already swiped to. An alternative to this technique could be to commit the optimistic state when we cancel and then apply any new updates o top of that. I might explore that in the future.\r\n\r\nRegardless it's important that the `action` associated with the swipe schedules some work before we cancel. Otherwise it risks reverting first. So I had to update this in the fixture.",

    "body": "### What kind of issue is this?\n\n- [x] React Compiler core (the JS output is incorrect, or your app works incorrectly after optimization)\n- [ ] babel-plugin-react-compiler (build issue installing or using the Babel plugin)\n- [ ] eslint-plugin-react-compiler (build issue installing or using the eslint plugin)\n- [ ] react-compiler-healthcheck (build issue installing or using the healthcheck script)\n\n### Link to repro\n\nwill update \n\n### Repro steps\n\nThis particular issue can be difficult to reproduce. \n\nThe short version is that in some situations, when there is a cyclic dependency between two files using the metro bundler, when you enable the React compiler it can cause hooks to be imported as 'undefined'.\n\nTo reproduce this an expo Project is needed:\n\nbabel.config.js\n```\nmodule.exports = (api) => {\n  api.cache(true);\n\n  return {\n    presets: [['babel-preset-expo', { jsxImportSource: 'nativewind' }], 'nativewind/babel'],\n    plugins: [\n      [\n        'babel-plugin-react-docgen-typescript',\n        {\n          exclude: 'node_modules',\n          include: 'components.*\\\\.tsx$',\n        },\n      ],\n    ],\n  };\n};\n```\n\nHere is an example babel config, aside from nativewind it is a basic setup:\n\napp.config.ts\n```ts\n  web: {\n    bundler: 'metro',\n    output: 'single',\n    favicon: './assets/images/favicon.png',\n  },\n  experiments: {\n    typedRoutes: true,\n    reactCompiler: true,\n  },\n```\nIn the experiements section, you'll want to setReactCompiler:true. You can see the issue when you use the web output of the expo project.\n\nIf you've enabled the compiler, you'll see additional output in the console:\n```sh\nExperimental React Compiler is enabled.\nStarting Metro Bundler\nwarning: Bundler cache is empty, rebuilding (this may take a minute)\n```\n\nYou should run the development build, and not expo go if possible.\n\n\nHere are the versions of critical dependencies that can reproduce the issue currently:\n\npackage.json\n```json\n  \"expo\": \"~52.0.36\",\n  \"react\": \"18.3.1\",\n  \"react-compiler-runtime\": \"^19.0.0-beta-21e868a-20250216\",\n  \"react-dom\": \"18.3.1\",\n```\nat the time of creating this issue, this should be the latest version of the react-compiler-runtime and also the latest version of expo 52, react is at 18.\n\n\nNow, to show some code that can express the issue:\n\n\nin one file you want to write a function that uses a hook , this may or may not be a hook or provider or just a simple function:\n\nexternal-function-file.tsx\n```tsx\nimport { useMyHook } from './SomeFile';\n\nexport function externalFunction() {\n  const { datum } = useMyHook();\n  return datum ;\n}\n```\n\nin the other file, you need to call this hook in some way, but you've also defined the same hook in this file\n\nSomeFile.tsx\n```tsx\n\ntype MyContext = { datum: string; }\n\nexport const myContext = createContext<MyContext | undefined>(undefined);\n\nexport useMyHook() {\n  const context = useContext(myContext);\n  return context;\n}\n\nexport function SomeComponent(){\n  const _datum = externalFunction();\n   return <View><Text>{_datum}</Text></View>\n}\n\n```\n\nThis is the gist of what can get a reliable break. You will see an error like:\n\n```sh\nUncaught Error\nuseMyHook is not a function\n```\n\nhowever, when you inspect the source code, its clearly defined (even in the source output in the browser), and also passes linters, such as eslint-plugin-react-compiler, as well as type checks in ts.\n\n\n### How often does this bug happen?\n\nSometimes\n\n### What version of React are you using?\n\n18.3.1\n\n### What version of React Compiler are you using?\n\n^19.0.0-beta-21e868a-20250216",

Generating a `react-server-client-manifest.json` file for the server bundle that maps client component file paths to their server module IDs and chunks. This manifest parallels the client-side `react-client-manifest.json` but contains server-specific metadata.\r\n\r\n2. For server bundles, the plugin tracks module IDs and chunks without creating AsyncDependenciesBlock for client components, as my implementation works with single-chunk server bundles (at least this is the case that I used the updated version of the plugin for).\r\n\r\nThe plugin combines these manifests during SSR to enable proper client component hydration, mapping between client and server representations of components.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst createSSRManifest = (\r\n  reactServerManifestFileName = 'react-server-client-manifest.json',\r\n  reactClientManifestFileName = 'react-client-manifest.json',\r\n) => {\r\n  const reactServerManifest = loadJsonFile(reactServerManifestFileName);\r\n  const reactClientManifest = loadJsonFile(reactClientManifestFileName);\r\n  const ssrManifest = {\r\n    moduleLoading: {\r\n      prefix: \"/webpack/development/\",\r\n      crossOrigin: null,\r\n    },\r\n    moduleMap: {}\r\n  };\r\n  // Map client IDs to server chunks for SSR\r\n  Object.entries(reactClientManifest).forEach(([absoluteFileUrl, clientFileBundlingInfo]) => {\r\n    const serverFileBundlingInfo = reactServerManifest[absoluteFileUrl];\r\n    ssrManifest.moduleMap[clientFileBundlingInfo.id] = {\r\n      '': {\r\n        id: serverFileBundlingInfo.id,\r\n        chunks: serverFileBundlingInfo.chunks,\r\n        name: '*',\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n  });\r\n  return ssrManifest;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe SSR manifest is then used with:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst ssrManifest = createSSRManifest(reactServerManifestFileName, reactClientManifestFileName);\r\nreturn use(createFromFetch(fetch('http://localhost:3000/rsc/<component-name>'), ssrManifest));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe implementation worked for my use case, but I'm not sure if it's the correct approach for handling server-side compilation in the webpack plugin.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Questions for Discussion\r\n\r\n1. Is this the correct approach for handling server-side rendering of server and client components?\r\n\r\n2. Manifest Generation:\r\n  - Is generating separate manifests (`react-client-manifest.json` and `react-server-client-manifest.json`) the right approach?\r\n  - Is my method of combining them into an SSR manifest correct?\r\n\r\n3. If it's not the correct approach, what is the planned approach for handling server-side rendering of server and client components when the server bundle is bundled with Webpack?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n",
